# Standard-Operating-Procedure-SOP
## What is SOP?
  SOP(standard operating procedure) is a set of written instructions which describes the step-by-step process that must be taken to properly perform a routine activity
  
## What can you learn from reading SOPs?
  1. Procedures to operate scientific experiment
  2. Procedures to build scientific equipment
  3. Professional physics knowledge in related SOP topic

## Motivation and Vision
  The CaYPT Committee hopes to encourage more young scientists to expand their understanding of experimental techniques by studyingÂ SOP. We offer a free online archive of experimental techniques to aid the education of young scientists worldwide.

## How to use this SOP collection?
  When you are looking for information of routine activity
  1. Click on the subject that you are looking for. (Technology and Electronics, Thermodynamics, Fluid etc.)
  2. Look for the file title that matches your demand.
  
## How to Write SOPs?
  To write a comprehensive SOP, you need to include the following info:
1. **Principle of Operation:** How does the routine activity in you SOP work from basic physics principles.
2. **Materials Required:** What materials do you need; where can you have access to the mentioned materials.
3. **Conclusion & General Procedures:** Summarize your reports and procedures of operation.
