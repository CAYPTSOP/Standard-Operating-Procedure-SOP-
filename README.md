# Standard-Operating-Procedure-SOP
## What is SOP?
  SOP(standard operating procedure) is a set of written instructions which describes the step-by-step process that must be taken to properly perform a scientific routine activity
  
## What can you get from reading SOPs?
  1. Procedures to operate an experiment.
  2. Procedures to build scientific equipment.
  3. Tutorials on using various tools.
  4. Professional physics knowledge.

## Motivation and Vision
  The CaYPT Committee hopes to encourage more young scientists to expand their understanding of experimental techniques by studyingÂ SOP. We offer a free online archive of experimental techniques to aid the education of young scientists worldwide.

## How to use this SOP collection?
  When you are looking for information of routine activity
  1. Click on the subject that you are looking for. (Technology and Electronics, Thermodynamics, Fluid etc.)
  2. Look for the file title that matches your demand.
 
  Each subject has a specific prefix, you can use this code to search for the subject you want:
  * **M** - Numberical Operation
  * **E** - Electronics and Technology
  * **T** - Thermodynamics
  * **F** - Fluid
  * **V** - Video Analysis
  * **S** - Sound and Accoustics
 
  
## How to Write SOPs?
  To write a comprehensive SOP, you need to include the following info:
1. **Principle of Operation:** How does the routine activity in you SOP function? Explain with detailed scientific principles.
2. **Materials Required:** What materials do you need? How can you access listed materials?
3. **Conclusion & General Procedures:** Summarize your reports and procedures.

Use the template and writing package attached to create your own SOP:
